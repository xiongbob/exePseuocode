1. Find the average score
A program is needed to prompt the user operator for ten exam scores, calculate the average score and display the result to the screen. 
The average score is calculated as the sum of the scores divided by the number of scores.

Answer 1:
Declare exam_num as numbers of exam and set up to zero first time
Declare exam_score as score for each exam
Declare sum_score as the sum of exam scores
Declare avg_score  as the average of scores
Set exam_num to zero
DOWHILE exam_num < 11
    Read exam_score
	sum_score += exam_score 
    add 1 to exam_num
	
ENDDO
avg_score = sum_score / exam_num 
Print avg_score to report


Answer 2:
Set total to zero
Set grade counter to one
While grade counter is less than or equal to ten
Input the next grade
Add the grade into the total
End While
Set the class average to the total divided by ten
Print the class average.



2. How much water runs off the roof
How much water runs off a roof in a rain storm?

To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and convert them to inches. 
(So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240"). Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water. 
Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38).

Write the pseudocode for the above problem. If you use the numbers provided in the example then the correct pseudocode will calculate the same result.

Answer:
Declare rain_storm_rate as rain storm rate
Declare rain_storm_weight_water as the total water weight in gallons 
Declare gallons of water on the roof per one inch thick 
Prompt user for rain_storm_rate (inch / hour)
Calculate rain_storm_weight_water = rain_storm_rate * 623.38  
Display rain_storm_weight_water
